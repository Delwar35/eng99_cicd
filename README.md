# CICD

## CI - Continuous Integration

- Develop Software
- Commit/merge
- Once the code has been commited it will be built and tested
- Feedback is given quickly
- If build/tests fail, the information is relayed quickly to the dev team so that they can make changes
- If build is successful and all tests have passed, the product is moved onto deployment in CD

## CD - Continuous Deployment

- The product is now able to make it's way to the production environment
- Once succesfully deployed, it can be accessed by public on release
- Feedback is then sent back to the dev team regarding performance
- The cycle continues
